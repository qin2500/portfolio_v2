                            I designed and implemented a constraint-based floor map generation system
                             using the Hierarchical Wave Function Collapse algorithm. This involved applying
                              principles of constraint satisfaction, data modeling, and algorithmic optimization 
                              to procedurally generate realistic floor plans. I presented the working prototype to 
                              Diamond Schmitt Architects, which led to discussions around potential collaboration and access 
                              to real architectural diagrams for further development.

                                Developed a web-based prototype using Next.js, LangChain, and React Flow to help authors visualize
                                and analyze their stories. By leveraging large language models, I automated the extraction of narrative 
                                elements, enabling the creation of digital storyboards. Collaborated closely with my research manager 
                                to refine project direction, focusing on providing innovative perspectives for authors. 
                                Designed a flexible software architecture that facilitated rapid prototyping and adaptation to evolving 
                                project needs.

                                Built a fullstack internal dashboard application from scratch using Spring Boot and React.js, greatly improving the collaboration between different departments.

                                Also, provided application support on existing projects by configuring servers using Putty, insuring that the application is running smoothly when needed 

                                and assisted with development of automation scripts using PowerShell and C, dramatically improving the efficiency of my team.
