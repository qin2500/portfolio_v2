                                I'm a 4th year student at the University of Toronto studying software Engineering. 
                                I'm passionate about software development, machine learning, and game development. 
                                I recently completed my internship at Autodesk Research, and currently seeking opertunities in 2025
                                So, let's connect and build something amazing together! When I'm not coding, you'll find me snowboarding, biking, or enjoying card games with friends.
